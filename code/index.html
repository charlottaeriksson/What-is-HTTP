  <h1>HTTP</h1>
  <p class="paragraph1">HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which might not really tell you that much about what it actually is. <br>
    At least to me, it wasn’t very clear to start with. 
    Basically, all I knew about it, was that a URL starts with either HTTP, or HTTPS and that HTTP is the old and not safe version, whereas HTTPS is the good one which your firewall will tell you is safe to visit. 
    <br>But it seems to be more than that. It’s some sort of communication system between browsers and web servers, amongst other very fine qualities I’m sure. So, I’m going to call it a phone. HTTP is now a telephone. 
  </p>
   <p class="paragraph2">It seems to be communicating more than an old-time telephone so let’s upgrade it and call it a smartphone, since it seems capable of sending HTML and other hypermedia documents.<br> 
    Getting into the whole thing a bit more, the way I understand it is that the communication deals with a client (the browser for instance) wants a server to deliver some goods.<br> 
    So, a HTTP request is being sent and a HTTP response is being delivered! Servers are apparently “computers in the cloud” which sounds very spiritual.
